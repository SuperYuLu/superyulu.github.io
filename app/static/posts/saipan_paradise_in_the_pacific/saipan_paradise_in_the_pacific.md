# Saipan: Paradis in the pacific

If someone ask me "What is the best place for a warm winter break ?", I would certainly recommand islands, especially after my visit to [*Saipan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saipan), the largest island of the [*Northern Mariana Islands*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands).  

Located in the western Pacific Ocean,  Northern Mariana Islands is a commonwealth of the United States. As of 2010, Saipan has a population of 48,220, as the second-largest island in the Mariana Islands, after [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam). Samll as it is, Saipan is about 12 m (19 km) long and 5.6 mi (9.0 km) wide. It takes less than 2 hours to drive around the island. The temperature here is pretty warm through the year, typically around 25 Celsius. So if you don't like the burning heat of Texas summer, or you can't stand the freezing cold of Southen China winter, Saipan is your choice whenever it is around the year.  

Our trip started from Guangzhou, China, with a short transfering stay in Seoul, South Korea. When finally landed in Saipan International Airport, it was about 1 a.m. local time. It was the smallest airport I've ever seen, unsurperisingly. As a tourisum island, you can imaging how many people come and go every day. We lined up for passing the border control of united states, waiting... After about 1 hour and a half, we finally step on this small island in Pacific.  

The taxi driver was a young guy with brown skin, waiting as scheduled at the narrow exit of the airport, help us picking up our baggage and get us on the car. It was raining outside the window, the street is narrow and buildings are low, we were excited and tie our eyes on the objects flying by outside the taxi. Get in the room of the small hotel, with some quick cleaning we fall in sleep, every cell was gethering energy and excitement for the joy of next few days.   

It was noon when we woke up, pack up our baggage we head out for the next hotel --- Fiesta resort. A small beach with playground was located behined the living building, where we took our first glance of the sea:

After unpacking our stuff, we decided to walk around the hotel.

It was about afternoon when we've done with our "late lunch", we booked a quick tour around island: a resident guide drove us around the must-see places on the island, which took about 4 hours and we visited plenty of places.

We took a lot of photo during the short tour in the afternoon, enjoying the our first day in Saipan. In the evening we had grilled beef in a famous local resturant. Didn't spend too much time wondering around after dinner, because we know there will be more exciting visit the next day --- the Managaha   
![beef](/static/posts/saipan_paradise_in_the_pacific/beef.jpg)   
The Managaha is a very small islet which lies off  the west coast of Saipan. There no residents on Managaha, but it's popular as a day-trip destination due to its wide sandy beaches and a lot of marine activities, such as snorkeling, parasailing and jet skiing.

We were suprised how clear the water is !

One thing must try is the snorkeling

And of course, *Diving*

The next day we move to another hotel, *the Mariana Resort*, which is a little bit far from the downtown area, so we decide to rent a car to travel around. The best part of Mariana resort is that, it's so quite and well decorated, which makes us feel very comfortable during our stay there.

By the end of the stay, there was one more thing we were always keeping in mind, watching the sunrise over the ocean!
