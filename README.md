# New Homepage Under Development   
------  
Finally I'm tired of any CSS frameworks like bootstrap, they just make your html files looks awful and put your creativity into a box.  
From here I decided to move to pure CSS, adding responsive design to my old homepage ![http://superyulu.github.io](http://superyulu.github.io).  
Additionally, I want to build a blog with python script as backend for content hosting. Not going with GCP or AWS for now, just stick to github. Since github pages does noly suppor static htmls, ao frozen-flask will be the choice to make this happen.   
The feature will be allowing me to write blog post in Markdown and python/Flask will make it to static htmls for blog updating, although there are a few technical problems to solve.  
I'm planning to have this done before the beginning of next spring semester.
